    <h4><p>Steps for making the dish</p></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and liver to cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
        <li>Remove shrimp and liver from the skillet using a slotted spoon, allowing oils and cooking juices to remain in the skillet. Place shrimp on a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add peas and carrots and corn to the skillet and cook, stirring intermittently, until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Push vegetables to the side of the skillet, pour eggs into the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir shrimp, liver,  rice, and green onions into the skillet. Drizzle evenly with soy sauce, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook until shrimp is reheated through, about 2 minutes.</li>


    </ol>
